I have been working as a security auditor and ethical hacker since 2010, dedicating my career to protecting digital infrastructures. In this blog, I share my daily experiences and practical solutions drawn from real-world challenges. Youâ€™ll find small scripts, custom tools, personal notes, and detailed explanations of bugs and vulnerabilities encountered on the job. My aim is to provide actionable insights and guidance for fellow security professionals and organizations looking to strengthen their defenses in an ever-evolving threat landscape.
